# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical and personal attributes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictive system for new input data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the `.ipynb` file)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```powershell
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all notebook cells to train the model and make predictions.
